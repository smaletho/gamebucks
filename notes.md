I can now search a game and add a basic review.

Next steps:
- Create UX for adding a review
- Browse reviewed games
- Browse recent activity

Later:
- User profiles
- User authentication
- Tips on games

Other notes:
- Offers expire. How long should I keep them?
- Need some kind of Google Play integration. 
  - Games available on Android aren't showing up in the search.
  - Add a game that's not found?
